                      At the edge of the known universe, sideways of the Magellanic cloud lies a planet Xerathum. Once flourishing and
                      prosperous, it used to be home for the universe's most talented engineers. Due to structural changes in the biosphere
                      caused by rampant industrial expansion life at Xerathum was about to go extinct. Engineers of Xerathum started modifying
                      fragile organic with artificial elements, which eventually led to complete robotization of Xerathum animals.

                      At the peak of Xerathum’s scientific power, it started actively exploring more and more distant parts of the universe by
                      sending reconnaissance spaceships with no living creatures onboard. Just robotiс animals.

                      Most of those ships were never meant to fly back, leaving their hibernated cyber-passengers locked inside forever.

                      One of these spaceships was found at Eleazar planet during one of the initial planet exploration missions. No one
                      knows
                      where other ships are.

                      Unusual crates were found in this spaceship’s cargo, which were then delivered to the surface lab. Crates were labeled
                      and examined. Studies showed that these crates contain robotic creatures of the unknown purpose.

                      The creatures are now known as Petobots, but they are much more than just pets. They seem to be strong and
                      intelligent,
                      ready to help in order to survive together with their new owners.

                      Petobots replicate the shape of a vast variety of living creatures. Some of them specialize in working in hard
                      conditions, others are better at tackling complex calculations. Petobot’s traits depend on its type.

                      Traits like resilience and longevity will make your Petobot more efficient for certain tasks whether used within the
                      DeepMine metaverse or not.
